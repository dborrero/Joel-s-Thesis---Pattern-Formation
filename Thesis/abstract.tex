A method of topological analysis known as computational homology is explored in the context of the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion model. Using the homology information of patterns generated by simulations of Gray-Scott (the Betti numbers) the Shannon entropy $S$ is calculated over a large set of parameters to elucidate features about the system. The results of the calculation show strong qualitative agreement with previous nonlinear analysis of the Gray-Scott system. Other applications of homology theory and the problems encountered therein are also discussed.
