A method of topological analysis known as computational homology is explored in the context of the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion model. Using the homology data of patterns generated by simulations of Gray-Scott (a time series of the Betti numbers), the Shannon entropy $S$ is calculated over a large set of parameters to elucidate features about the system. The results of the calculation show strong qualitative agreement with previous nonlinear analysis of the Gray-Scott system. In addition, a formal mathematical description of homology is provided to uncover the roots of the theory. Other applications of homology, its viability as an analytic technique, and the problems encountered therein are also discussed.
