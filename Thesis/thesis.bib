   abstract = {In 1952 Turing published a paper which showed how under restricted conditions a class of chemical reactions could give biological patterns in diffusion-coupled cells. Although this theory has been much discussed, little has been learnt about the range and type of pattern it can generate. In order to do this and to see how stable the patterns are, we have examined the system in detail and written a computer program to simulate Turing's kinetics for two morphogens over various assemblies of cells. We find that on one-dimensional lines of cells, patterns can indeed be produced and that the chemical wavelengths follow all of Turing's predictions. The results show that stable repeating peaks of chemical concentration of periodicity 2–20 cells can be obtained in embryos in periods of time of less than an hour. We do find however that these patterns are not reliable: small variations in initial conditions give small but significant changes in the number and positions of observed peaks. Similar results are observed in two-dimensional assemblies of cells. On rectangles, random blotches are observed whose position cannot be reliably predicted. On cylinders whose circumference is less than the chemical wavelength, annular stripes are produced. For larger cylinders, blotches that lie very approximately on helices are generated; again sharp prediction of the detailed pattern is impossible. The significance of these results for the developing embryo is discussed. We conclude that Turing kinetics, at least in the simple cases that we have studied, are too unreliable to serve as the generating mechanism for features such as digits which are characterized by a consistent number of units. The theory is however more than adequate by these criteria to specify less well-defined developing patterns such as those of hair follicles or leaf organization. It is emphasized however that the Turing theory is quite unable to generate regulative systems, only mosaicpatterns can be produced.},

   abstract = {A model is put forward which is capable of generating chemical maps whose concentration contours are similar to the patterns seen on the flanks of zebras, cats and other mammals. The model derives from the reaction-diffusion kinetics invented by Turing (1952) and it is assumed that the necessary molecular apparatus is present in each cell of a two-dimensional array and that the cells are in diffusion contact. The model was expressed in differential equation form and solved digitally under a range of different initial, boundary and other conditions. The main forms of pattern that the model generated were spots of variable complexity, rings, and both vertical and horizontal stripes. If morphogen concentration levels are assumed to act as melanin-production switches, then a common basic mechanism is capable of generating a variety of skin patterns. Simple spots such as those found in the fallow deer or the serval, F. serval, are generated if the kinetics are initiated simultaneously in each cell and interpretation depends only on the presence or absence of morphogen, which is assumed for the deer to be an activator and for the cat a suppressor of pigment formation. The reticulated pattern of the giraffe is generated if there is a single high-value threshold. Complex spots typical of the leopards can be produced if there are different concentration thresholds for different colours. Rings of pattern typical of those found on cat tails are generated if the cellular array is a very narrow cylinder. Horizontal stripes are generated if the kinetics in each cell are initiated by a diffusion gradient whose source is the dorsal line of cells and these stripes may break up into spots to give a pattern very similar to that of, for example, the fishing cat, F. viverina. The vertical stripes of the caffre cat, F. caffra, or the zebras are formed if the kinetics are initiated by a vertically-moving constant-velocity wave which also allows morphogen diffusion between previously uncoupled cells. Thus far, the mechanism has generated neither the triradii that are commonly found on forelimbs nor the rings often observed on mammalian limbs. It does however incorporate the randomness that characterizes skin pattern, its operation is of the scale required in embryogenesis, it can be made stable to growth and it can explain certain degenerate patterns. Analysis of a spotted zebra in the light of the model provides evidence that zebra stripes arise from the inhibition rather than the stimulation of melanin; their pattern is thus of white stripes on a black background.},

   abstract = {Numerical simulations of a simple reaction-diffusion model reveal a surprising variety of irregular spatiotemporal patterns. These patterns arise in response to finite-amplitude perturbations. Some of them resemble the steady irregular patterns recently observed in thin gel reactor experiments. Others consist of spots that grow until they reach a critical size, at which time they divide in two. If in some region the spots become overcrowded, all of the spots in that region decay into the uniform background.},

   abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},
