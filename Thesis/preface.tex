    \chapter*{Preface}
	I wrote this thesis with the intention of making it as accessible as possible. However, given the visual nature of pattern formation, it's difficult to capture the most compelling aspects of this project on paper (\ie the cool pattern videos). For this reason I supplement the standalone thesis presented here with a web page designed to enhance the reader's understanding of the problem. As of writing, the page \url{http://joelhawkins.info/thesis} provides an overview of this thesis and displays video simulations of each pattern discussed as well as interactive charts of the results derived in \refChapter{ch:results}.
