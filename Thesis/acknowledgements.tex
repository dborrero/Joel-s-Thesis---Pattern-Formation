It has only recently dawned on me what this process has meant to me. Post-ironic affectation aside, I genuinely love and appreciate everything that this school has done for me; how it has motivated me, inspired me academically and artistically, frustrated me, and pushed me to the end of my rope.

Of course, it is not the institution of Reed itself I have to thank. It is the individuals: my friends, my colleagues, and my mentors. I must first acknowledge my advisor Daniel for holding my hand through this entire exercise, guiding me through darkness when I felt like I was just hiding here. Next, I owe much of my growth as an artist to Marisa who never let my (many) opinions go unchallenged. I could not show enough gratitude towards my mother and father who have encouraged me in every endeavor. I must lastly thank Drew, Theo, and Monty. You have supported me when I've flailed, congratulated me in my successes, humored me in failure, and greatly shaped who I claim to be in this moment. Your close friendship has truly been the most meaningful aspect of my adult life; for that, I reserve a special place for the memories of our time at Reed.
